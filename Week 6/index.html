        Programming Design Systems:

“We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture”

This quote stood out to me because I agree that instead of being more object oriented, we look more at the system as a whole and the objects are looked more closely on the way things are done. 

“Today we find ourselves facing new challenges, not because this definition of design has changed much, but because the products we’re required to build has changed.”

I think the challenges we are now facing are based more on how society and technology has been evolving. The base model of technology has already been built so now the changes and challenges that occur are more around it and how it should evolve.

“I have chosen to publish this book for free online without a publisher. The main reason for this is freedom.” 

I think this quote is very interesting in terms of having a publisher might necessarily mean having freedom but yet at the same time it does. I think it is interesting that you feel more free without a publisher. 

     What Do Prototypes prototype?:

“Prototypes are widely recognized to be a core means of exploring and expressing designs for interactive computer artifacts.”

I really like this quote since I think prototyping has become a very significant part of design in building and designing interactive products or any products really. The world has been evolving and prototyping has become an integral part of solving and presenting a problem and solution in the design world. 
     
“Prototypes provide the means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions.”
     
I think this quote really makes sense in term of it is really a way now to express the solution and problems that the team is designing. I used to take prototype as a literal product but now I understand that it is a way to evaluate and examine the problem and solution.
